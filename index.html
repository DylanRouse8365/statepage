<p>
Mainy people think that Nebraska is completley flat and all you can see is fields for miles.
This is true is some parts of Nebraska but it is far from being flat. 
There are many areas where there are many trees and several large hills in one area.
If you want to see a lot of flat land with hardly any trees, take a trip to Denver, Colorado and be ready to experience the longest, boring drive ever.
 This drive will really show you how unique the terrain is here in Nebraska.
